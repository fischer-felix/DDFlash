# DDFlash
A simple bash script to flash .iso files to a USB device.

Instructions:
In the first step you get asked what device you would like to flash (/dev/sdb;sdc;sdd) are the defaults (these are the most common locations for USB devices to be mounted). Secondly a file choosing dialog should pop up, in which you select the .iso file that you would like to flash.
